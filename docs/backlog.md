# Backlog

New rows route through `/super-bootstrap:log` — one funnel for classification, dedup, and ID assignment. Bugs, debt, design gaps, and unverified feature ideas all land here as rows; whether each is real or worth doing is decided at `/super-bootstrap:todo` triage on pickup, not at capture.

**When a card is owed:** only for work that exits the current flow **incomplete** — deferred or dropped. Work completed in-flow, whoever directed it, carries no card debt. The trigger is completion-state (observable), not worth (triage's call).

**Row deletion:** the resolving session — via `/super-bootstrap:commit` doc-sync, or manually on resolve. Direct `git commit` skips the sweep; clean up stale rows when noticed.

**Three categories** distinguished by ID prefix:

- **`BUG-###`** — broken behavior. Surface symptom may hide deeper cause.
- **`DEBT-###`** — working but rotting (test fixture rot, stale dep, cleanup owed).
- **`GAP-###`** — design gap or unverified capability idea, never properly specced. Forward feature ideas land here; triage decides drop / spec.

No phase prescription per category — when an item rolls into a session, the harness phase triage decides which superpowers phases run. Surface "clear fix" can become design work after evidence; pre-routing biases that judgment.

**ID high-water mark:** `BUG-018` · `DEBT-023` · `GAP-036` — last consumed ID per category. Next ID = max+1 from this line, bumped in the same write. Resolved rows are deleted but their IDs stay consumed (history = `git log --grep="<id>"`); never re-derive IDs from open rows.

**Row shape** — stable ID + frozen claim, newest at top. When resolved, **delete the row** — git history is the archive.

```
### {BUG|DEBT|GAP}-### — {one-line summary}

**Logged:** {date} · **Source:** {where this surfaced}
**Problem:** {what's broken / rotting / missing}
**Area:** {files or module}
**Prior:** {one-line suspected cause or proposed fix — optional}
```

The claim is write-once — captured at the richest-context moment, read cold by later sessions. Sessions that pick a row up work from it; working history lives in specs/plans, not on the row.

### DEBT-023 — doc-sync-scan per-commit Sonnet dispatch burns ~8-12k tokens for a read-only advisory

**Logged:** 2026-07-25 · **Source:** GitHub issue #24 (claude-config-manager 2026-07-23 harness-pain harvest, absorbed via /pull-issue)
**Problem:** `doc-sync-scan` fires per-commit after the grep-gate pre-filter hits and returns a text advisory with 0 writes by design. Observed burning ~8-12k output tokens per run; across a 5-day window: spotify-radio ×2 (~21.5k combined), stock (~11.5k), super-bootstrap (~19.7k). The grep-gate's false-positive rate or the scan's output scope may be too wide relative to its advisory-only yield.
**Area:** `agents/doc-sync-scan.md`; `/super-bootstrap:commit` commit door; grep-gate pre-filter
**Prior:** Raise grep-gate precision (reduce how often the Sonnet scan fires) or cap/trim the scan's output scope. Dropping doc-sync is not a direction (CLAUDE.md marks it non-negotiable).

### DEBT-022 — todo subagent classify+render pass not right-sized to working-set size

**Logged:** 2026-07-25 · **Source:** GitHub issue #25 (downstream adopter claude-config-manager, absorbed via /pull-issue)
**Problem:** `/super-bootstrap:todo` dispatches a subagent that re-classifies every open row from scratch on every invocation, regardless of working-set size. Observed on sb 2.24.1 with 4 open rows / 3-row need-me board (one venue group): ~34.3k subagent tokens / ~226s per bare dispatch. The full classify pass ran over every row; no computation reuse between invokes. The board is intended as a frequent, low-stakes glance; per-glance cost is disproportionate to a small working set.
**Area:** `agents/todo.md`; `plugins/super-bootstrap/skills/todo/**`
**Prior:** Right-size the classify+render work to actual working-set size — skip or shorten classify phases when row count is small.

### DEBT-021 — log agent ID allocation has no recovery contract for concurrent session collision

**Logged:** 2026-07-25 · **Source:** GitHub issue #26 (repo owner, absorbed via /pull-issue)
**Problem:** `agents/log.md` step 4 requires bumping the ID high-water mark in the same write, but specifies no recovery when two concurrent sessions both read the header before either writes — both compute the same `max+1` and allocate the same ID. The Edit tool's `old_string` mismatch catches the collision (stale-state detection), but what the subagent does after that failure is model discretion, not a spec contract. Same exposure on `PARK-000` high-water in `docs/parked.md`. Cost of a slip is higher than volatile state — the backlog is a durable queue, not something a fresh session regenerates.
**Area:** `agents/log.md` step 4; `docs/backlog.md` ID high-water mark line; `docs/parked.md` `PARK-000` line
**Prior:** Add explicit recovery to step 4: on Edit failure (HWM mismatch), re-read the header and recompute the ID before retrying.
