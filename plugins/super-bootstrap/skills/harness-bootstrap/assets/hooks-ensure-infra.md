# Hooks ensure-infra — content-aware default-on hook install

harness-bootstrap ships three hook assets. Unlike drain's worktree infra
(`../drain/assets/ensure-infra.md`), install runs **unconditionally** — no opt-in
confirm. All are safe-by-default: `harness-grounding` never blocks —
`additionalContext` only; `entry-nudge` is an injector-only UserPromptSubmit hook —
one context line per prompt, never blocks, never exits non-zero (either would erase
the user's prompt); `commit-channel` fires only on git commit and denies raw commits
from worker subagents — the main session is never blocked. They ship as
**frozen assets** beside this file; ensure-infra places them by mechanical copy /
merge — never regeneration, so there is no drift between repos. Run as
`SKILL.md §2a-hooks`, part of Phase 2a.

## The three assets

| # | Frozen script asset | Destination | Frozen settings snippet | Merge target |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | `hooks/harness-grounding.sh` | `.claude/hooks/harness-grounding.sh` | `hooks/harness-grounding.hook.json` | `.claude/settings.json` → `hooks.PreToolUse[]` |
| 2 | `hooks/entry-nudge.sh` | `.claude/hooks/entry-nudge.sh` | `hooks/entry-nudge.hook.json` | `.claude/settings.json` → `hooks.UserPromptSubmit[]` |
| 3 | `hooks/commit-channel.sh` | `.claude/hooks/commit-channel.sh` | `hooks/commit-channel.hook.json` | `.claude/settings.json` → `hooks.PreToolUse[]` |

Copy each script with Bash `cp` (plain file copy — invoked via `bash "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh"`, so no executable bit is required). Merge each `.hook.json` entry into `.claude/settings.json`'s target array via a guarded read-modify-write that touches only that array — the same merge mechanism as drain's `read-hook.json` (`../drain/assets/ensure-infra.md` step 3), reused rather than re-derived.

## Retired hooks — remove on re-sync

Three hooks are retired — delete them from any already-bootstrapped repo on re-sync:

- `docsync-gate` (formerly a PreToolUse commit gate) and `docsync-scan` (its
  self-stamping scan script) — doc-sync now runs gateway-inline in the commit door
  (`/super-bootstrap:commit`), so the token gate and its scan are gone.
- `docsync-stamp` (formerly a PostToolUse hook) — retired earlier when its
  token-write folded into `docsync-scan`.

On any re-sync of an already-bootstrapped repo:

1. For each of `docsync-gate.sh`, `docsync-scan.sh`, `docsync-stamp.sh` — if the
   file exists at `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`, delete it.
2. Remove any `.claude/settings.json` hook entry whose `command` references one of
   those scripts (match by script filename) — a surgical array-element removal,
   touching no other entry.

Idempotent: a repo with none of the retired scripts and no matching settings entry is
already clean, nothing to do.

## Idempotency — content-aware (copy-on-drift)

Existence alone is not enough: an upstream fix to a frozen script must reach repos
that already have an older copy. Each frozen script carries a version marker on its
second line — `# FROZEN <name> vN` (e.g. `# FROZEN commit-channel v3`). The
present-check compares the **installed** copy's marker against the **asset's** marker
and re-copies on any mismatch (missing, older, or byte-differing):

```
scriptCurrent(name):
  installed = .claude/hooks/<name>.sh
  exists(installed)   AND
  marker-line of installed == marker-line of asset hooks/<name>.sh
  # mismatch (absent | different version | edited) → re-copy the asset verbatim

hooksInfraPresent():
  scriptCurrent(harness-grounding)   AND
  scriptCurrent(entry-nudge)         AND
  scriptCurrent(commit-channel)      AND
  settings.json hooks.PreToolUse  has an entry whose command references harness-grounding.sh   AND
  settings.json hooks.PreToolUse  has an entry whose command references commit-channel.sh   AND
  settings.json hooks.UserPromptSubmit has an entry whose command references entry-nudge.sh
```

All current → skip silently (`✓ current`), no message. Any drift → re-copy the drifted
script (verbatim, overwriting the stale copy) and/or merge the missing settings entry,
report what changed, stage with the Phase 2c commit. This is copy-on-drift, not a
migration engine — the asset is always the source of truth, the installed copy is
replaceable. **No confirm gate** — default-on, unlike drain's `infraPresent()`
install-confirm.

## Hook activation

`settings.json` hook edits are picked up mid-session by the file-watcher (no restart
— `hook-agent-type.md`), so the guards go live shortly after the merge.

## Roles

Durable harness config, not a temporal pipeline artifact — so no cleaner:

- **Creator** — harness-bootstrap Phase 2a-hooks (first run, and every sync re-run —
  idempotent, so a re-run only fills what's missing).
- **Consumer** — the consumer repo's own `Edit`/`Write` calls (`harness-grounding`),
  `git commit` calls (`commit-channel`), and every prompt (`entry-nudge`).
- **Cleaner** — none; the infra lives until the user removes the harness.

## Self-containment (hard constraint)

All three scripts and their settings snippets are copied verbatim — no template
substitution, no reference to any super-bootstrap-specific state beyond what
harness-bootstrap itself stamps (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `docs/`).
`harness-grounding.sh`'s injected `additionalContext` text names only git log,
`.claude/rules/index.md` (or the rule file matching the edited path), and the
verify pass — never `/load-harness-principles` or any other device-only skill,
since those do not exist on a bare consumer repo. `entry-nudge.sh`'s injected text
names only `docs/backlog.md` and the bundled `/super-bootstrap:todo` +
`/super-bootstrap:log` skills. `commit-channel.sh`'s deny text names only
`/super-bootstrap:commit` (a bundled plugin skill every consumer has) — no
device-only skill names, no super-bootstrap state.
