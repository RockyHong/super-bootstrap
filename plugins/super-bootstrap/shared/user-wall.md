# User wall — the one judgment two doors share

A card **needs the user** when finishing it requires any of:

- **A decision only the user owns** — a design fork with no ruling on the card or in `docs/decisions.md`, a product / business / scope call, an unruled `## Verdict — surface`, a `## Design` block with no approval line.
- **Taste** — visual, copy, UX, or naming acceptance where "looks right" is the test.
- **Human eyes** — a verify step no tooling can run (device, manual play-through, listening, a browser the user drives; a fully automated headless suite is tooling, not eyes).
- **A party outside the repo** — the card or its outward thread waits on someone's reply, a portal, a key.
- **Real cost or an irreversible move** — paid APIs, external compute, a push / release / delete the user has not asked for.

Everything else runs without the user. Judge the card's **next step**, not its whole tail: a build whose only human step is final acceptance runs to that acceptance and stops there.

Consumers: `/super-bootstrap:needs-me` lists what passes this test; `/super-bootstrap:autorun` admits what fails it. Read here, never restated.
